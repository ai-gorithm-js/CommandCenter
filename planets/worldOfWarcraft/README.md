# Introduction

The Probe is the Protoss worker unit, warped in at the Nexus. It harvests resources, has a low-powered melee attack, and can warp-in any Protoss building. All Protoss buildings other than a Pylon, Nexus, and Assimilator must be built within power range from a nearby Pylon or Warp Prism. Unlike its Terran and Zerg counterparts, the Probe does not have to remain in place to keep working on a building being warped in, and it instead can perform other tasks, such as warping in more buildings or returning to harvest resources.
