# Introduction

The SCV (Space Construction Vehicle) is the Terran worker unit. It harvests resources, constructs buildings and can repair all Terran mechanical units and buildings. As a building is constructed, the SCV must remain at the site until complete. If the building SCV is killed, the building's construction will halt. Building SCVs can be given queued assignments such as mining minerals and even constructing more buildings. If an SCV builds a Refinery it will automatically start mining gas unless it has been given another command in the queue.

# Tools


Sometimes it is best to not give out the blueprint of an unfinished technology


# Description for engineers
0. Condensed and interpolated 5000 steps into 5 simple step 
1. Using the tools above, create Artificial Interactive Entities to harvest/mine every type of crypocurrency resources possible in the web.
2. Finding new tools to upgrade the hardware and software of this artificial interactive entity, Implement algorithms to protect this aritifcial interactive entity
3. Find a suitable memory address for the decillion lines of binary bits to live inside. Ranging from </a><span class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/ai-gorithm-js/CommandCenter/blob/main/fpga/gameboy.jpg"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> simple electronic devices </a> to <span class="edit-link"><a href="https://www.asus.com/ca-en/Laptops/ROG-GL553VD/specifications/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> intermediate gaming laptop    </a> to <a href="https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/development-boards/fpga-prototyping-boards/mps2" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> advanced fpga boards  </a>. 
4. At this point, the Artificial Interactive Entity is constantly improving it's own memory capacity, discovering new resources to mine, improving the rate of growth of existing resources, basically with the resources swaped into money. You buy more fpga boards and program more AI bots to replicate itself. ( deep learning libraries,methodology, pattern recognition, basically every type of free library resources possible neatly placed inside because there's an infinite amount of space in existence which can hold an infinite set of knowledge containing every single detail about reality itself) 
5. The engineers can sleep safely and sound while the SVCs harvest cryptocurrency 24/7. 

# Description for civilians

1. The engineers above are making artificial robots that collect monetary resources, ranging from : bitcoin, to US dollars, to paypal currency, to anything that can be traded for anything in this planet.
2. These robots also record every identifiable conversation, public chat log and insert the raw data into a complexe level of database for machine learning. Basically, learning what to say to a civilian like yourself based on reponse. 
3. These interactive robots above will try to blend into society and try not to get caught doing online labour jobs that is meant for a civilian like yourself.
4. The Intelligence of the robots will be based on how many line of codes the engineer jam in their brain. 
5. They live inside my laptop, eats electricity, produces heat, stress for the engineers, and communicate with wifi.
6. These interactive robots also help you aim better, or just aim for you provided that you have given the engineers the set of instructions for them and the jars.
7. These interactive robots perform manual labour jobs for you while you dream at night. ( basically passive income )

# Potential Risk

Getting sued by the company that makes the tools.
Getting sued by the company that grows the type of resources.
Getting sued by the university for abusing their free tools.
