# CommandCenter
Intermediate programming project:  SCV

# Introduction

The SCV (Space Construction Vehicle) is the Terran worker unit. It harvests resources, constructs buildings and can repair all Terran mechanical units and buildings. As a building is constructed, the SCV must remain at the site until complete. If the building SCV is killed, the building's construction will halt. Building SCVs can be given queued assignments such as mining minerals and even constructing more buildings. If an SCV builds a Refinery it will automatically start mining gas unless it has been given another command in the queue.

# Tools


Sometimes it is best to not give out the blueprint of an unfinished technology


# Description for programmers

Using the tools above, create Artifial Interactive Entities to harvest every type of resources possible in the planet ( digital world ).

# Description for civilians

I'm making artificial robots that collect monetary resources, ranging from : bitcoin, to US dollars, to paypal currency, to anything that can be traded for anything.
These robots also record every identifiable conversation, public chat log and insert the raw data into a complexe level of database for machine learning. Basically, learning what to say to a civilian like yourself based on reponse. 
The Intelligence of the robots will be based on how many line of codes i jam in their brain.
